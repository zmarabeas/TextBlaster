We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this Policy:

## Data Security

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers behind firewalls.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Service. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk.

## Data Retention

We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service. We will also retain and use your personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

For client contact information and messaging records, we maintain this data for the duration of your service with us, plus any additional period required by law or necessary for legal proceedings. Message logs and transmission records may be retained for extended periods to comply with telecommunications regulations.
