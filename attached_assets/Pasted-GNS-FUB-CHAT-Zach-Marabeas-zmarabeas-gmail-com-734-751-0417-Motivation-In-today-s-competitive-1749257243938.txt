Motivation

In today's competitive automotive sales and finance industry, effective communication and marketing strategies are paramount for success. However, existing messaging solutions often present challenges such as complexity, high costs, and inefficient workflows for salespeople. Recognizing these shortcomings, the motivation behind the GNS_FUB_CHAT App project is to revolutionize the way car dealerships and finance businesses interact with customers, streamline marketing efforts, and enhance overall operational efficiency.

Background:

The currently available messaging systems fall short in one or more of the following: 

cost, simplicity, or customization 

Avachato is a cloud-based communication platform tailored for businesses, especially in the automotive industry, aiming to streamline personalized messaging and marketing campaigns. It offers features such as mass texting, automated responses, and lead management to facilitate efficient customer engagement. However, Avachato is known for its robust capabilities but also comes with relatively high costs, which may pose challenges for businesses with budget constraints. Despite this, businesses utilize Avachato for its user-friendly interface and comprehensive messaging solutions, aiming to enhance customer interactions and streamline communication processes.

SlickText is a versatile messaging platform offering comprehensive features like mass texting, automated responses, and detailed analytics for businesses across various industries. With its user-friendly interface and integration capabilities, SlickText enables businesses to engage with their audience effectively. However, its relatively high pricing plans and potential limitations in customization options may pose challenges for some businesses.

Project Broadcast is a messaging solution designed to facilitate communication and marketing campaigns for businesses, including those in the automotive industry. It offers features such as mass texting, automated responses, and lead management, empowering businesses to engage with their audience efficiently. With its user-friendly interface and robust capabilities, Project Broadcast enables businesses to streamline communication processes and enhance customer interactions. However, businesses should be aware of potential limitations in customization options and consider the platform's pricing plans when evaluating its suitability for their needs.

There are hundreds of messaging solutions available, most of which are very similar to the few we outlined above. Others include SimpleTexting, TextMagic, Sakari, and Postscript. Most fail to offer a complete solution without charging high amounts for onboarding fees and support, or high messaging fees.

Overview of Canada’s Data Privacy Laws

Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA)
‍PIPEDA is the primary federal privacy law in Canada that governs the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by private sector organizations. It applies to businesses engaged in commercial activities across provincial and national borders. The law has been grandfathered over time and gone through a few revisions along the way. Any company engaged in commercial and transactional activities involving the personal information of Canadian citizens must comply with PIPEDA.

Digital Privacy Act
This is an amendment to PIPEDA that came into effect in 2015. It introduced several changes, including mandatory breach notification requirements and increased fines for non-compliance and/or failure to report breaches (up to $100,000).

Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL)
Canada's Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL) governs electronic communications and commercial messages. While not strictly a data privacy law, it imposes requirements on obtaining consent for sending electronic messages, including email and text messages, and contains provisions related to the installation of computer programs. In the event of a violation, offenders may have to pay an administrative monetary penalty (AMP), which can cost up to a maximum of $1 million for an individual, or $10 million for a business.

Quebec
‍Law 25 — Effective September 2023, Law 25 is designed to provide individuals with more control over their information and the ability to request and access their information from organizations who have it. If an individual requests specific information, organizations must provide it within 30 days or risk penalties and fines of up to $25 million.

Notable Case:
On February 14, 2024, the British Columbia Civil Resolution Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) found Air Canada liable for misinformation given to a consumer through the use of artificial intelligence chatbots (“AI chatbot”).
