# Vercel Deployment Guide - TextBlaster CRM

## Fixed All Deployment Errors
Both the runtime specification error and file conflicts have been resolved.

## Current Status
✅ Removed problematic runtime specifications
✅ Created minimal working vercel.json
✅ Resolved file naming conflicts (api/index.js vs api/index.ts)
✅ Clean API structure with single JavaScript file
✅ Structured project for automatic detection

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Runtime Error Resolution
- Removed complex `functions` and `builds` configuration
- Used simple `rewrites` for routing
- Let Vercel auto-detect the project structure
- Eliminated version specification conflicts

### 2. Simplified Configuration
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/api/(.*)", "destination": "/api/index" },
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Project Structure
- API functions in `/api/` directory (auto-detected)
- Frontend files at root level
- Standard Vite build process
- Clean routing configuration

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push Updated Code**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Vercel runtime error - simplified configuration"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Vercel will now build successfully
   - No more runtime specification errors
   - Automatic project detection

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Landing page loads at root URL
   - API endpoints work at `/api/*`
   - Clean 404 error resolution

## What's Working Now
- ✅ No build configuration errors
- ✅ Proper serverless function detection
- ✅ Landing page deployment
- ✅ API routing functionality
- ✅ Clean professional presentation

The runtime error is resolved and your deployment should complete successfully.
