# TextBlaster Deployment - API Issue Identified

## Current Status: API Routing Issue

The frontend builds correctly, but API endpoints are returning 404 errors. This is a common Vercel deployment issue.

## Quick Fix for Working Deployment

**Option 1: Static Landing Page Only**
- Your landing page works perfectly
- Remove API calls from frontend temporarily
- Deploy as static site to showcase design

**Option 2: Fix API Structure** 
- Restructure API endpoints for Vercel serverless functions
- Each endpoint needs its own file in `/api` directory
- Update frontend to match new API structure

## Current Working Features

✅ **Landing Page** - Professional design with animations
✅ **Pricing Plans** - Three tiers including Enterprise
✅ **Legal Pages** - Terms and Privacy Policy
✅ **Responsive Design** - Works on all devices
✅ **Theme Support** - Dark/light mode

## Immediate Deployment Steps

For landing page showcase:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy landing page - API endpoints to be restructured"
git push
```

## Environment Variables Still Needed

When API is fixed:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Supabase connection
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - Payment processing
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` - Frontend payments
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - SMS functionality
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - SMS authentication
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` - SMS sender number
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Security token

Your professional landing page is ready to showcase your TextBlaster CRM.
