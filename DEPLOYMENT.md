# Fixed Deployment Guide for TextBlaster

## Problem Solved

The issue was that Vercel was serving raw source code instead of the built application. I've fixed this with:

✅ **Proper vercel.json** - Fixed build configuration and routing
✅ **Simplified API handler** - Works correctly with Vercel serverless functions  
✅ **Clean build process** - Frontend builds to /dist, API functions work properly

## Steps to Deploy

### 1. Push Updated Code to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel deployment - proper routing and build"
git push
```

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel
Your existing Vercel project should automatically redeploy with the fixes. If not:
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click "Redeploy" on your project
3. Use "Other" preset (as discussed before)

### 3. Environment Variables (Same as Before)
**Database:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your Supabase PostgreSQL connection string

**Stripe Payments:**
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - From Stripe Dashboard (starts with sk_)
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY` - From Stripe Dashboard (starts with pk_)

**Twilio SMS:**
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` - From Twilio Console
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` - From Twilio Console  
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` - Your Twilio phone number

**Session Security:**
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Generate a random 32+ character string

## What's Fixed

**Frontend:** Now properly builds to /dist directory and serves the React app
**API Routes:** Simplified serverless function handles all /api/* requests correctly
**Build Process:** Uses npm run build command with proper output directory
**Routing:** Fixed routing between frontend and backend

## Test After Deployment

1. Visit your Vercel URL - should show the TextBlaster landing page
2. Test registration/login functionality 
3. Verify API endpoints work correctly
4. Check that the app loads properly instead of showing source code

Your TextBlaster CRM should now deploy and work correctly on Vercel!
