# Vercel Deployment Issue - Frontend Not Building

## Problem Identified
Your website shows server code instead of the React frontend because:
1. Vercel isn't building the client application properly
2. The build output directory is incorrect
3. Frontend files aren't being served

## Current Fix Applied
Updated vercel.json to:
- Build from client directory: `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
- Output to correct directory: `client/dist`
- Proper routing for SPA and API

## What Should Happen Now
When you redeploy, Vercel will:
1. Navigate to client directory
2. Install React dependencies
3. Build the frontend application
4. Serve the built React app instead of server code

## Expected Result
- Landing page with TextBlaster branding
- Professional CRM interface
- Working navigation and pricing pages
- API endpoints functional at /api/*

The server code display issue should be completely resolved.
